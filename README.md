# Michael Dillard and Alex Caulfield, Self-Driving Car User Interface

### Product Description
This interface is designed for the passengers in the front seat of a self-driving car. The interface will be a touch screen on the front dashboard in the middle of the car, and will activate when the car is started. The interface is not designed to be utilized while driving; it is purely for self-driving cars as it requires the user to look at and pay attention to the interface when interacting with it. The interface will include features such as setting a route, playing music,  controlling air conditioning, and viewing the carâ€™s status (current fuel efficiency, miles til empty, etc).
